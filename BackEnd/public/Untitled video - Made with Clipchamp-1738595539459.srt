1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,680
There's a kind of nuclear

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,200
power you may not be familiar

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,600
with, similar to atoms

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,600
colliding in the sun.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,680
That's nuclear fusion, and it

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,360
could revolutionize how clean

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,720
energy is produced on Earth.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,000
You actually have to go

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,480
hotter than the sun. If your

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,120
company is trying to reduce

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,560
your environmental footprint

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,240
through using clean energy,

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
we have the solution for you.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,480
Recent breakthroughs in

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,960
nuclear fusion research

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,160
revealed that adopting this

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,720
technology can reduce carbon

18
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,720
emissions by up to 70%,

19
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,760
making it a game changer for

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,840
companies committed to

21
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,200
sustainability. With hydrogen

22
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,400
as its only byproduct,

23
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,320
nuclear fusion offers a safe,

24
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,120
clean energy that aligns with

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,800
global trends towards greener

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,880
practices. You may wonder,

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,560
why not use nuclear fission?

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,280
Well, fusion doesn't create

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,680
long-lived radioactive waste

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,200
like fission does. It

31
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,520
replicates the process that

32
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,200
powers the sun, harnessing

33
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,800
the energy released on atomic

34
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,240
nuclear fuels. Thistechnology holds the

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,520
potential to generate 10

36
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,720
times the energy of fossil

37
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,240
fuels without harmful

38
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,480
emissions. Additionally,

39
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,240
unlike other clean energy

40
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,760
sources like solar and wind,

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,120
which can be limited by

42
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,200
weather conditions and

43
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,520
geographical constraints,

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,560
nuclear fusion offers a more

45
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,640
efficient and reliable

46
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,400
solution. This technology

47
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,720
provides a consistent and

48
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,120
high-output energy supply,

49
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,880
making it an ideal choice for

50
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,160
companies looking to power

51
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,600
critical IT infrastructure.

52
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,760
By transitioning to nuclear

53
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,840
fusion, business can achieve

54
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,440
greater energy efficiency and

55
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,040
reliability, while also

56
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,120
supporting environmental

57
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,480
sustainability. I'm working

58
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,000
in an industry that's doing

59
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,440
incredible things, that

60
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,280
offers the promise to

61
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,400
decarbonize countries and

62
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,120
industries for the future. In

63
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,960
the last decade, the number

64
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,320
of fusion-focused private

65
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,680
companies has rocketed,

66
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
growing to at least 42 around

67
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,560
the world and attracting more

68
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,760
than $6 billion in

69
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,080
investment. Commonwealth

70
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,920
Fusion Systems in America is

71
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,600
backed by Bill Gates, and

72
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Jeff Bezos has invested in

73
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,480
General Fusion, which is

74
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,640
using a different kind of

75
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
reactor to a tokamak.

76
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,212
With visionary leaders like

77
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:19,575
them investing in nuclear

78
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,578
fusion technology, many

79
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:23,021
leading companies are already

80
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,463
exploring its benefits. Will

81
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,547
your company be next to join

82
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,909
this transformative movement?

can benefit your industry.
